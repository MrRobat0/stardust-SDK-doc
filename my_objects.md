# Uploading an object

## GLB Format

OBJ format is the easiest because you only have to upload the file and they will be available for all platforms.

- Go to the [object list page](https://stardust.neogoma.com/object_list)
- Once you're on the object upload page select [create a new object](https://stardust.neogoma.com/add_bundle)
- Select the option "Upload an OBJ file"
- Fill in the name
- Upload the GLB file (max size 10 mb).
- Click on "Create object"
