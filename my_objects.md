# Uploading an object

## Cloud content
These contents will be stored on our server and you will be able to use them in your applications if you decide to use the cloud content.

- Go to the [object list page](https://stardust.neogoma.com/object_list)
- Once you're on the object list page select [create a new object](https://stardust.neogoma.com/add_bundle)

### GLB Format

GLB format is the easiest because you only have to upload the file and they will be available for all platforms. These file format can also include complex animations. You can find some GLB files samples [here](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models).

- Select the option "Upload a 3D model"
- Fill in the name
- Select the GLB file (max size 80 mb).
- Click on "Create object".

### Image Format

We had a lot of request to support different images for different usages (floor plans, NFT, arts..). We decided that the most flexible way for users to use pictures in our app would be to allow people to directly link from external sources (you can put your images on [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), [Imgbb](https://imgbb.com/), your own server...). 

- Select the option "Upload a picture"
- Fill in the name
- Fill in the picture URL.
- Click on "Create object".

## Local content

If you don't want to use the cloud solution and make your objects locally, please follow [this tutorial](developer/1_1_setup_project.md).
